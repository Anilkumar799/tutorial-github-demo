SQL:
   In order to understand SQL,we have to first understand  different Database Concept like:
      1.Database
      2.DBMS
      3.Data Models
      4.RDBS
      5.SQL etc..
    1.Database
       The place we can store the related data and later retrive the data is known as Database
          Storing the related data like employee ID,employee name,employee salary,department etc. can be stored 
          Retriving the data based on some conditions

       Software that stores data in databases in an an organised way to make it easier to create, retrive, update etc..
       examples: DBase, FoxPro, MYSQLL, Oracle, MangoDB, SQLite, Cassandra and many more
    3.Data Models
        Define how related data is connected to each other and stored inside the database.
        Types of Data Models:
             Hierarchical Model
             Network Model
             Entity-Relationship model
             Relational model: 
                   Data is stored in the form of tables

                   It is a popular and widely used by most of the DBMS Software 
     4.RDBMS
         DBMS using relational data models are known as RDBMS
         Employes for RDBMS Software:
            1.Oracle
            2.MS-SQL Server
            3.DB2
            4.MYSQL 
            5.MS-ACCESS
            6.etc...
     5.SQL
        Programming language for relational database
        stands for structured Quary language 
        The following things can be performed on Database using SQL:
            Inserting data 
            Retrieving data
